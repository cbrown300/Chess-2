#Chess 2 - A new kind of chess
Got inspired to make this from a YouTube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcivL8u176Y. 

I got busy with other things while doing it and frustrated integrating Godot with C#. I want to try and finish this in the future, but will likely try learning gdscript and redoing everything.

I managed to get a board set up and got the crow(rook) piece programmed. However the code is messy and not reflective of my best work.
